## Calculation

Every star ship has its own time before it need to ressuply. Let`s take Milleniun Falcon for example.

According to the Star Wars Api, the Mellenium Falcon can run for 2 Months before a stop, at a rate of 75 MGLT / Hour.

With this, we can know that this ship can run:

72 MGLT / HOUR

75 * 24 = 1.800 MGLT / DAY

1.800 * 30 = 54.000 MGLT / MONTH

54.000 * 2 = 108.000 MGLT / 2 MONTHS

The given example shows a input of 1.000.000 MGLT.

1.000.000 / 108.000 = 9,259259259259259 
which translates to 9 stops before resupply
